ITMD 442 - Lab 3

Git Repository URL: https://github.com/rarmenta1/ITMD442-Lab-3

----

**Project Description** - This project allows users to look at contact information, insert, edit, and delete contact information which means I had to practice with some concepts of CRUD operations in a Node JS Express application. Users are able to input the first name, last name, an email address, and a note to create a contact. Only first and last names are required to insert data so there is some validation that prevents users from creating or editing the contact that has no text.

**Development Environment** - For this project I used my Windows 10 desktop, with Node JS version v18.13.0, I used Visual Studio Code to write my code, and I used GitHub Desktop to push my files here.

**Installation/Running Instructions:** â€“ In order to run the app, you are going to have to make sure NodeJS is installed. Once it is installed, you would then need to clone this repository and place it wherever you want. Next, you are going to need to open your command line and go to the directory of the cloned repository. Once there you are going to need to type *npm i* to install the dependencies. Next, you need to type: SET DEBUG=itmd442-lab2:* & npm start. Finally, you just travel to localhost:3000 on any web browser.

**Insights and Results** - Honestly, this was a bit easier than I thought it would be. When I first took a look at the assignment sheet I thought this was going to be the worst assignment I will ever create. But thankfully it went pretty smoothly with the only issue being that I could not get the date created/modified fields to work. I am not really sure how to implement that right now but I am hoping that in the next couple days I am able to figure out why so I know what to do for future assignments or works.
